## Introduction to MCP Debugging

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools, data sources, and applications. Effective debugging is essential for developing reliable MCP servers and integrating them with applications.

The MCP ecosystem provides several debugging tools that operate at different levels:

1. **MCP Inspector** - An interactive debugging interface for direct server testing
2. **Claude Desktop Developer Tools** - For integration testing and log collection
3. **Server Logging** - Custom logging implementations for error tracking and monitoring

## MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is the primary tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. It provides a visual interface that allows developers to interact with their MCP server implementations.

### Key Features

1. **Interactive Interface**: A web-based UI for testing MCP servers
2. **Transport Selection**: Supports different transport methods for connecting to servers
3. **Resource Management**: Lists all available resources with metadata
4. **Prompt Testing**: Displays available prompt templates with arguments and descriptions
5. **Tool Testing**: Lists available tools with schemas and descriptions
6. **Notifications**: Displays logs and notifications from the server

### Usage Modes

The Inspector can be used in two primary modes:

#### UI Mode

UI Mode provides a visual interface for interactive testing and debugging:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

#### CLI Mode

CLI Mode enables programmatic interaction from the command line:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node build/index.js
```

### Configuration

The Inspector can be configured through the UI or via configuration files:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["build/index.js", "arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {
        "key": "value",
        "key2": "value2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Desktop Developer Tools

Claude Desktop provides several tools for debugging MCP integrations:

### Server Status Checking

Claude Desktop interface shows basic server status information:

1. Connection status icon displays:
   - Connected servers
   - Available prompts and resources

2. Tools icon displays:
   - Tools made available to the model

### Log Viewing

Claude Desktop captures detailed MCP logs:

```bash
# Follow logs in real-time
tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```

These logs capture:
- Server connection events
- Configuration issues
- Runtime errors
- Message exchanges

### Chrome DevTools Integration

Developer tools can be enabled for advanced debugging:

1. Create a `developer_settings.json` file:
```bash
echo '{"allowDevTools": true}' > ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/developer_settings.json
```

2. Open DevTools using `Command-Option-Shift-i`

This provides access to:
- Console for client-side errors
- Network panel for inspecting message payloads and connection timing

## Server Logging Strategies

Effective logging is crucial for debugging MCP servers:

### Server-Side Logging

For servers using local stdio transport:
- Messages logged to stderr are captured by the host application
- Never log to stdout as it interferes with protocol operation

For all transports, server-side logging can be implemented:

```python
# Python example
server.request_context.session.send_log_message(
  level="info",
  data="Server started successfully",
)
```

```typescript
// TypeScript example
server.sendLoggingMessage({
  level: "info",
  data: "Server started successfully",
});
```

### Important Events to Log

- Initialization steps
- Resource access
- Tool execution
- Error conditions
- Performance metrics

### Structured Logging Best Practices

- Use consistent formats
- Include context
- Add timestamps
- Track request IDs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Working Directory Issues

When using MCP servers with Claude Desktop:
- Working directory may be undefined (`/` on macOS)
- Use absolute paths in configuration files
- For command-line testing, the working directory is where you run the command

### Environment Variables

MCP servers inherit only a subset of environment variables automatically. Override defaults using:

```json
{
  "myserver": {
    "command": "mcp-server-myapp",
    "env": {
      "MYAPP_API_KEY": "some_key",
    }
  }
}
```

### Server Initialization Problems

Common issues include:
1. **Path Issues**
   - Incorrect server executable path
   - Missing required files
   - Permission problems
   - Solution: Use absolute paths for `command`

2. **Configuration Errors**
   - Invalid JSON syntax
   - Missing required fields
   - Type mismatches

3. **Environment Problems**
   - Missing environment variables
   - Incorrect variable values
   - Permission restrictions

### Connection Problems

When servers fail to connect:
1. Check Claude Desktop logs
2. Verify server process is running
3. Test standalone with Inspector
4. Verify protocol compatibility

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Initial Development**
   - Use Inspector for basic testing
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add logging points

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test in Claude Desktop
   - Monitor logs
   - Check error handling

3. **Testing Changes**
   - Configuration changes: Restart Claude Desktop
   - Server code changes: Use Command-R to reload
   - Quick iteration: Use Inspector during development

### Error Handling

- Log stack traces
- Include error context
- Track error patterns
- Monitor recovery

### Performance Tracking

- Log operation timing
- Monitor resource usage
- Track message sizes
- Measure latency

### Security Considerations

1. **Sensitive Data**
   - Sanitize logs
   - Protect credentials
   - Mask personal information

2. **Access Control**
   - Verify permissions
   - Check authentication
   - Monitor access patterns

## Conclusion

Effective debugging is essential for developing reliable MCP servers. The tools provided by the MCP ecosystem—MCP Inspector, Claude Desktop Developer Tools, and server logging—offer comprehensive debugging capabilities at different levels.

By following the best practices outlined in this report, developers can implement robust debugging strategies for their MCP server implementations, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
