# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Debugging Tools

This repository contains research and comprehensive documentation about the debugging tools available for Model Context Protocol (MCP) development.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for enabling AI assistants to interact with external tools, data sources, and applications. It provides a well-defined interface that allows developers to create servers that can be used by AI models to access external functionality.

## Debugging Tools Overview

MCP provides several important debugging tools to help developers test and troubleshoot their MCP server implementations:

1. **MCP Inspector** - An interactive debugging interface for testing MCP servers
2. **Claude Desktop Developer Tools** - Integration testing and log collection tools
3. **Server Logging** - Custom logging implementations for error tracking and monitoring
